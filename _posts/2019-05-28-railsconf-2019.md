title: RailsConf 2019
---

I went to my first [RailsConf](https://railsconf.com/) this year and had a great time. I've been working with Rails for 5 years now and have never really gone to a technology-specific conference before this. It was really convenient that it was in my city of Minneapolis and I didn't have to bother with traveling. I got to meet a lot of interesting people and attend great talks, so I thought I'd share some of my favorite ones I got to see in person.

### [Modern Cryptography for the Absolute Beginner, Jeffrey Cohen](https://railsconf.com/program/sessions#session-804)

Jeff gave a great breakdown of the history of cryptography and how we use it today. He gave the best explanation of asymmetric and symmetric cryptography I've ever heard. He's a professor with great pedagogy skills. I'd recommend this talk for beginners as well as experienced developers.

### [Scalable Observability for Rails Applications, John Feminella](https://railsconf.com/program/sessions#session-812)

John left me with a lot to think about with this talk. Driven by guiding principles, he gives a good framework to use when thinking about what things to monitor and measure, especially in the context of distributed applications and systems.

I got a lot of the same vibes from [a Rails performance workshop](https://www.railsspeed.com/) I attended in San Francisco by [Nate Berkopec](https://twitter.com/nateberkopec) last October. The theme of having a small set of principles guiding you and measuring what matters is something that resonates a lot. I highly recommend attending one of Nate's upcoming workshops. They're intensive and value-packed for the Rails/Ruby developer.

### [The Past, Present, and Future of Rails at GitHub, Eileen M. Uchitelle](https://railsconf.com/program/sessions#session-769)

Eileen gave a talk about the history of GitHub and Rails from the early days until today. I was surprised that GitHub was forked from Rails master for a period of 10 years. She gave a breakdown of the effort she drove at GitHub to come back to Rails master, which was successful in the last year or so. Learned and related a lot about the challenges with updating a legacy system. It was great to hear how much she reiterated GitHub's commitment to Rails and Ruby. Definitely recommend checking this talk out.

### [Learn to Make an API-Backed Model with Squareâ€™s Ruby SDK, Shannon Skipper](https://railsconf.com/program/sessions#session-845)

Shannon gave a really cool talk where he progressively built a Rails model backed by an API (Square's Customers API), all using `ActiveModel` subclasses. At the end, we had a model we could use to query, add to etc...but to an outside API. Pretty sick. I'm already thinking of doing something similar for a few APIs we maintain and consume at my dayjob.

### [Rethinking the View Layer with Components, Joel Hawksley](https://railsconf.com/program/sessions#session-810)

This was the talk that blew my mind the most at the conference. Joel from GitHub explained how the `v` in Rails' MVC has always been a second-class citizen, when it comes to testing and maintenance. He progressively builds up a more Railsy/Ruby way of doing things using components. The end result is a strange but compelling cousin of React...but in Ruby? They're already using this in prod at GitHub and are planning on releasing it as a library to the community; super excited.

Muy cool talk, I highly recommend watching this one multiple times.

### [Code Spelunking: teach yourself how Rails works, Jordan Raine](https://railsconf.com/program/sessions#session-749)

In this talk, Jordan told a great tale and showed approaches on how to explore any Rails or Ruby codebase. I was familiar with some of the techniques but learned some new ones too like combining method introspection with some of the tooling that comes with Pry.

Another awesome talk that I recommend watching a few times.

Overall I enjoyed my first RailsConf. Learned a lot and ran into some familiar faces and met new ones, well-run. Our team was able to finally meet [Yasuo Honda](https://github.com/yahonda), the maintainer of the [Oracle-enhanced ActiveRecord adapter](https://github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced) gem that pretty much all of our work depends out at my dayjob.

I had a great time and hope to attend RailsConf [next year at Portland](https://twitter.com/railsconf/status/1124071989113688065)!
